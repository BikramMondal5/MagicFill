## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
The MagicFill project workflow is designed to streamline the form-filling process using advanced AI and automation tools. Below is the detailed workflow:

1. Step 1 of 2: Submit Your Document:
- Users upload their documents (e.g., Aadhar Card) in PDF format.
- The form ensures that only valid, password-free PDFs are accepted.

2. Classify Document:
- Uses Google Gemini to classify the document as valid or invalid.
- Invalid documents trigger a retry process where users can re-upload their files. If valid, workflow proceed to next step for relevant text extraction. 

3. Extract from File:
- Extracts relevant data from the uploaded PDF file for further processing.

4. Application Suitability Agent
- Generates a structured output, including fields like Name, Address, Email, Phone number etc..

5. Save to Airtable:
- Stores the extracted data in Airtable, an applicant tracking system.

6. Redirect to Step 2 of 2:
- Redirects users to the second step of the application process. The government portal or any other important application form is automatically filled by Gemini using the extracted data.

7. Step 2 of 2: Application Form:
- Users review and amend the pre-filled application form.
- Fields include Name, Address, Email, Telephone, Education etc.

8. Form Success:
